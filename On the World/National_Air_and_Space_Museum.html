            The National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, also called the Air and Space Museum, is a
            museum in Washington, D.C., US. It was established in 1946 as the National Air Museum and opened its main
            building on the National Mall near L'Enfant Plaza in 1976. In 2018, the museum saw approximately 6.2 million
            visitors, making it the fifth most visited museum in the world, and the second most visited museum in the
            United States.[2] The museum contains the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia, the Friendship 7 capsule which
            was flown by John Glenn, Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1 which broke the sound
            barrier, the model of the starship Enterprise used in the science fiction television show Star Trek: The
            Original Series, and the Wright brothers' Wright Flyer airplane near the entrance.

            The National Air and Space Museum is a center for research into the history and science of aviation and
            spaceflight, as well as planetary science and terrestrial geology and geophysics. Almost all space and
            aircraft on display are originals or the original backup craft. It operates an annex, the Steven F.
            Udvar-Hazy Center, at Dulles International Airport, which opened in 2003 encompassing 760,000 square feet
            (71,000 m2). The museum conducted restoration of its collection at the Paul E. Garber Preservation,
            Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland as of 2014, while moving restoration and archival
            activities into the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Udvar-Hazy annex.

            The Air and Space Museum was originally called the National Air Museum when formed on August 12, 1946 by an
            act of Congress and signed into law by President Harry S. Truman.[3][4] Some pieces in the National Air and
            Space Museum collection date back to the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia after which the Chinese
            Imperial Commission donated a group of kites to the Smithsonian after Smithsonian Secretary Spencer
            Fullerton Baird convinced exhibiters that shipping them home would be too costly. The Stringfellow steam
            engine intended for aircraft was added to the collection in 1989, the first piece actively acquired by the
            Smithsonian now in the current NASM collection.

        <p>
            After the establishment of the museum, there was no one building that could hold all the items to be
            displayed, many obtained from the United States Army and United States Navy collections of domestic and
            captured aircraft from World War I. Some pieces were on display in the Arts and Industries Building, some
            were stored in the Aircraft Building (also known as the "Tin Shed"), a large temporary metal shed in the
            Smithsonian Castle's south yard. Larger missiles and rockets were displayed outdoors in what was known as
            Rocket Row. The shed housed a large Martin bomber, a LePere fighter-bomber, and an Aeromarine 39B
            floatplane. Still, much of the collection remained in storage due to a lack of display space.
        </p>
        <p>
            The combination of the large numbers of aircraft donated to the Smithsonian after World War II and the need
            for hangar and factory space for the Korean War drove the Smithsonian to look for its own facility to store
            and restore aircraft. The current Garber Facility was ceded to the Smithsonian by the Maryland-National
            Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1952 after the curator Paul E. Garber spotted the wooded area from
            the air. Bulldozers from Fort Belvoir and prefabricated buildings from the United States Navy kept the
            initial costs low.

            Construction of current building
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ribbon Cutting Ceremony at the Dedication of the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian. The
            museum's prominent site on the National Mall once housed the city's armory, which became Armory Square
            Hospital during the Civil War; it nursed the worst wounded cases who were transported to Washington after
            battles.[6] The rest of the site was occupied by a cluster of temporary war buildings that existed from
            World War I until the 1960s.
        </p>
        <p>
            The space race in the 1950s and 1960s led to the renaming of the museum to the National Air and Space
            Museum, and finally congressional passage of appropriations for the construction of the new exhibition
            hall,[8] which opened July 1, 1976 at the height of the United States Bicentennial festivities under the
            leadership of Director Michael Collins, who had flown to the Moon on Apollo 11.

            Later history
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center opened in 2003, funded by a private donation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The museum received COSTAR, the corrective optics instrument installed in the Hubble Space Telescope during
            its first servicing mission (STS-61), when it was removed and returned to Earth after Space Shuttle mission
            STS-125. The museum also holds the backup mirror for the Hubble which, unlike the one that was launched, was
            ground to the correct shape. There were once plans for it to be installed to the Hubble itself, but plans to
            return the satellite to Earth were scrapped after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003; the mission
            was re-considered as too risky.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Smithsonian has also been promised the International Cometary Explorer, which is currently in a solar
            orbit that occasionally brings it back to Earth, should NASA attempt to recover it.
