            In 1976, the Việt Bắc autonomous area was dissolved and the Việt Bắc Museum was handed over to Ministry of
            Culture and Information. Since then, the Museum has changed its activities from an integrated museum to the
            one specialized in ethnic cultures. At decision No. 508/QĐVH dated March 31, 1990 signed by Minister of
            Culture, it was renamed the Museum of the Cultures of Vietnam’s Ethnic Groups and became one of the seven
            national museums of Việt Nam.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Museum of the Cultures of Vietnam’s Ethnic Groups is a big cultural center with its functions and tasks
            of doing research, collection, inventory, conservation, exhibition, popularization and bringing into play
            the heritage of traditional cultures of the Vietnamese ethnic groups in the entire country.
