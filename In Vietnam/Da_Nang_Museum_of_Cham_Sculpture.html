            The museum currently houses and displays the richest and most representative collection of religious
            sculptures of the ancient kingdom of Champa which has existed and flourished for decades with many heritages
            still remaining preserved, including the system of magnificent temples and other tangible and intangible
            cultural heritages.

        </p>
        <h2>
            History
        </h2>
        <p>
            The procedure of collecting Champa sculptures has begun in the late 19th century. Numerous exhibits were
            found in the region of Da Nang, Quang Nam and neighboring provinces then gathered at the museum with the
            name at that time “The Garden of Tourane”.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="full-page">
        <img src="../IMG/IMG-Hung/15-Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture/Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture (3).jpg" alt=""
            style="float: left">
        <p>
            The collection marks the merits of passionate French archaeologists, especially those who worked for the
            French School of the Far East (L’École Française d’Extrême – Orient, abbreviated as EFEO). Some sculptures
            have been moved to France, others have been preserved at museums in Hanoi and Saigon (now known as Ho Chi
            Minh City) but most of the characteristic artefacts are still stored at The Garden of Tourane ( Tourane is
            the name of Da Nang at that time).
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea of building the Museum to preserve Champa sculptures had been sparkled since 1902. In particular,
            it must highlight the EFEO project with the great contribution of Henri Parmentier, Dean of the Department
            of Archeology. After significant effort and determinations, the first building was started constructing in
            1915, completed in 1916 and opened to the public in 1919.
        </p>

    <div class="full-page">
        <img src="../IMG/IMG-Hung/15-Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture/Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture (4).jpg" alt=""
            style="float: right;">
        <p>
            The original design of the building was initiated by two French architects, Delaval and Auclair, based on
            Henri Parmentier’s proposal of using the features of the Champa temples. Despite later expansions, the
            original architectural features have remained intact to this day after over 100 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 1930s, the Museum was first expanded. The nearly-1000-meter-square building was arranged into the
            basic galleries shaping the itinerary within the museum till today, namely: Tra Kieu, My Son, Dong Duong,
            Thap Mam Hall and the corridors of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum.
        </p>

            style="float: left">
        <p>
            In 2016, the city restored all buildings, adjusted and upgraded the galleries. The refurbishment project
            aims to connect all buildings of the museum into a sightseeing tour. Especially, the main exhibition
            showcases Champa sculpture collections, the rest are specialized rooms on Inscription, Pottery, Music,
            Festivals and Traditional vocations of Cham people in Ninh Thuan nowadays. Performance space and educational
            activities are positioned on the second floor and the renovated service area is in the garden.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2011, Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture was listed as the first-class museum in Vietnam. Thereby, that
            approves the role and contributions of the Museum in the conservation and promotion of the values of Champa
            cultural heritage in particular and Vietnam in general.

            language family inhabit mainly on the red-soil Central Highlands and coastal stretches of land in Central

            documents, the museum exhibition system was built in an advanced and modern way. Electronic information
            technology equipment and audio softwares help revive the settlement landscapes and cultural life of 54
            ethnic groups, attracting the visitors.

            Apart from the fixed exhibition, every year, the museum conducts dozens of mobile exhibitions all over the
            country, from remote areas to borders and islands, meeting the people’s demand to enjoy culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together with activities of the museum, its officials often participating in topics of ministry and
            institute levels on ethnic cultures. In addition, the lectures, talks and exchange of experience are also
            carried out by its staff to introduce and popularize the values of ethnic cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
            At present, the museum’s outdoor exhibition system has been completed with spaces of 6 cultural areas:
            Mountainous area in the North, Valley, Middle land – North VietNam, Central VietNam – Coastal area, Trường
            Sơn – Central Highlands and South Vietnam Plain. Every cultural area has a space of organizing festivals
            with landscape structure of its own characters and a specific house as a focal point to introduce the
            cultural values of the Vietnamese ethnic groups to visitors.
