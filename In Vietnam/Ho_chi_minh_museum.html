        <h2>
            History
        </h2>
        <p>
            The museum is located in the house that was formerly the headquarters of the Emperor Transport Corporation
            (Messageries Impériales) - one of the first companies built by the French colonialists after using Saigon.
            The house was built in the middle of 1862 and completed in 1863 with Western architecture, but on the roof,
            two dragons are attached to the moon according to the motif of "Two dragons adoring the moon" - a kind of
            decoration familiar with Vietnamese temples. With that unique architecture, the headquarters of the Emperor
            Transport Corporation (Hotel des Messageries Impériales) is also known as Nha Rong and the harbor is also
            called Nha Rong Wharf. In 1870, the Imperial Shipping Company (Hotel des Messageries Impériales) changed to
            the Maritime Shipping company (Messageries Maritimes) but the mission and scope of activities remained
            unchanged. The company replaced the moon on the roof with the company's logo, which is: crown, anchor and
            horse's head; precisely because that company is called Head Horse.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1955, after the French failed in Vietnam, the commercial port of Saigon - including Nha Rong was
            transferred to the South Vietnamese government to manage. They restored the roof and replaced the two old
            dragons with two other dragons with a head-turning posture. In 1965, the Dragon House was used by the US
            military to use the headquarters of the US Military Aid Receiving Agency. In 1975, after the national day,
            the Dragon House - the symbol of Saigon - was under the management of the Vietnam Maritime Administration.
        </p>
        <p>
            A particularly significant event related to the port of Saigon and Ho Chi Minh City was that on June 5,
            1911, Uncle Ho (at that time named Van Ba) got off the Amiral Latouche Tréville ship from the wharf. Saigon
            port, to go abroad to find a way to save the country. He has traveled through France and many countries with
            many different continents, so that after 30 years of returning to the country, directly lead the Vietnamese
            people to stand up to liberate the nation from the yoke of colonialism, to national independence and
            reunification of the country.

        <p>
            To remember the above event, after the day of national reunification, the Dragon House was kept as a
            souvenir of President Ho Chi Minh according to Decision No. 1315/QD-UB, dated September 7, 1979, of the
            Committee Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of his death - this
            place opened to visitors the exhibition "The cause of finding the way to save the country of President Ho
            Chi Minh (1890 - 1945)". After more than 10 years of operation, on October 30, 1995, the People's Committee
            of Ho Chi Minh City issued the decision No. 7492/QD-UB-NCVX to change the "Ho Chi Minh Memorial Park" into a
            "Museum. Ho Chi Minh - Ho Chi Minh City branch". The museum has the task of researching, collecting,
            inventorying, preserving, displaying and propagating the life and great revolutionary career of President Ho
            Chi Minh on the basis of documents and artifacts of the Museum; special emphasis is placed on the fact that
            Uncle Ho left to find a way to save the country and Uncle Ho's deep affection for the people of the South
            and the affection of the people in the South for Uncle Ho.
