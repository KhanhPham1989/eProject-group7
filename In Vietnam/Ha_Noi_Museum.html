            Hanoi Museum currently holds more than 70,000 documents and artifacts (data until June 2021) of many
            different materials, proving the history of thousands of years of Thang Long - Hanoi. A number of very
            valuable artifacts and collections are appreciated by the limited school: co-valued collections; collection
            includes porcelain; material collection ivory jade; collection of artifacts of the resistance revolution…
            Hanoi Museum has 4 artifacts/groups that are very valuable national items, including: The gray-blue glazed
            ceramic lampstand of the Mac dynasty of artisan Dang Huyen Thong; Bat Trang Long Communal House of Le

            For many years, the Hanoi Museum has focused on collecting and building regular display content. The regular
            display of the Museum has 7 themes and 33 sub-themes including: Theme 1: Nature; Theme 2: Journey to Thang
            Long; Theme 3: Thang Long; Theme 4: Hanoi in the XIX - XX centuries; Theme 5: Resistance; Theme 6: Building

            experiential exhibition areas, a thematic exhibition area and an outdoor display section. The display design
            of the current Hanoi Museum has beautiful, modern graphics, logical display content, and uses many modern
            technologies to maximize content, messages and ideas.

        <h3>
            History
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Air and Space Museum was originally called the National Air Museum when formed on August 12, 1946 by
            an act of Congress and signed into law by President Harry S. Truman.[3][4] Some pieces in the National
            Air and Space Museum collection date back to the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia after which
            the Chinese Imperial Commission donated a group of kites to the Smithsonian after Smithsonian Secretary
            Spencer Fullerton Baird convinced exhibiters that shipping them home would be too costly. The
            Stringfellow steam engine intended for aircraft was added to the collection in 1989, the first piece
            actively acquired by the Smithsonian now in the current NASM collection.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="full-page">
        <img src="../IMG/IMG-Hung/11-Ha Noi Museum/Ha Noi Museum (4).jpg" alt="" style="float: right;">
        <p>
            After the establishment of the museum, there was no one building that could hold all the items to be
            displayed, many obtained from the United States Army and United States Navy collections of domestic and
            captured aircraft from World War I. Some pieces were on display in the Arts and Industries Building,
            some were stored in the Aircraft Building (also known as the "Tin Shed"), a large temporary metal shed
            in the Smithsonian Castle's south yard. Larger missiles and rockets were displayed outdoors in what was
            known as Rocket Row. The shed housed a large Martin bomber, a LePere fighter-bomber, and an Aeromarine
            39B floatplane. Still, much of the collection remained in storage due to a lack of display space.
        </p>
        <p>
            The combination of the large numbers of aircraft donated to the Smithsonian after World War II and the
            need for hangar and factory space for the Korean War drove the Smithsonian to look for its own facility
            to store and restore aircraft. The current Garber Facility was ceded to the Smithsonian by the
            Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1952 after the curator Paul E. Garber spotted
            the wooded area from the air. Bulldozers from Fort Belvoir and prefabricated buildings from the United
            States Navy kept the initial costs low.

        <h3>
            Construction of current building
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ribbon Cutting Ceremony at the Dedication of the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian. The
            museum's prominent site on the National Mall once housed the city's armory, which became Armory Square
            Hospital during the Civil War; it nursed the worst wounded cases who were transported to Washington
            after battles.[6] The rest of the site was occupied by a cluster of temporary war buildings that existed
            from World War I until the 1960s.
        </p>
        <p>
            The space race in the 1950s and 1960s led to the renaming of the museum to the National Air and Space
            Museum, and finally congressional passage of appropriations for the construction of the new exhibition
            hall,[8] which opened July 1, 1976 at the height of the United States Bicentennial festivities under the
            leadership of Director Michael Collins, who had flown to the Moon on Apollo 11.
