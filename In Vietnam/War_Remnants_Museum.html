        <hr>
        <p>
            On August 31, 1858, the French attacked Da Nang, marking the beginning of their war of aggression and
            colonial rule in Vietnam. For nearly 100 years the Vietnamese people fought with great fortitude for
            national liberation. After the August Revolution, President Ho Chi Minh made a Declaration of Independence,
            putting an end to French colonialism and asserting Vietnam’s right to independence. But the French
            colonialists, and then American imperialists, persisted in their aggression and conspiracy to sustain
            foreign domination over and introduce neo-colonialism to Vietnam. For 30 years the Vietnamese people,
            courageous and strong, remained willing to sacrifices their lives for the sake of freedom.

            History
        </h2>
        <p>
            April 30, 1975 saw the overwhelming victory of the Vietnamese people, and the restoration of peace and the
            nation’s freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
            To cherish the memories of the Vietnamese people’s great heroism in their struggle against foreign
            aggressions and to denounce the crimes and highlight the tragic consequences of those aggressions, the
            Exhibition House for the Crimes of America and Its Puppet Government opened to the public on September 4,
            1975. Its name was changed first into the Exhibition House for the Crimes of the Wars of Aggression on
            October 11, 1990, and the War Remnants Museum on July 4, 1995.

            Vietnamese museum network as well as the International Network of Museums for Peace (INMP) and International
            Council of Museums (ICOM), it researches, collects, preserves, and displays documents, photos and artefacts
            revealing the crimes committed during the wars of aggression against Vietnam and their consequences. This is
            how the Museum has decided to educate the public, especially young generations, about the spirit of struggle
            for national independence, the sense of opposition to the wars of aggression and safeguarding peace and
            solidarity between nations.

            Although decorative motifs used in the museum architecture are made of various materials (wood, iron,
            cement), they are common patterns and similar to many contemporary ancient architectural works. Each detail
            has different meanings but in general, they have a good meaning. This is the intangible cultural heritage
            that is contained in the Building, in particular decorative architectural motifs. These motifs also show the
            cultural exchange of Vietnam - France, making the museum architectural work have not only Asian but also
            Western features.
